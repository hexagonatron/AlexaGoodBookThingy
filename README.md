# AlexaGoodBookThingy

An Amazon Alexa app in which you can ask "how many books did I read in {year}". The app then uses the goodreads api to find how many books you read in the given year.

Written to experiment with voice apps and to utilise the GoodReads api. Also used to keep track of a friendly competition on who could read the most books.

Unfortunatly Goodreads have shut down their API so this app no longer works.
